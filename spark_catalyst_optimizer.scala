// Spark Catalyst Optimizer is a query optimization engine in Apache Spark
// It uses a combination of rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques
// to generate an efficient execution plan for a given query

// Catalyst Optimizer consists of several components:
// 1. Parser: converts SQL query into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
// 2. Analyzer: resolves references and checks for errors in the AST
// 3. Optimizer: applies optimization rules to the AST to generate an optimized plan
// 4. Planner: generates a physical execution plan from the optimized plan

// Example of a more complex Spark query
val df = spark.sql("SELECT *, sum(score) as total_score " +
  "FROM mytable " +
  "WHERE category = 'sports' " +
  "GROUP BY team " +
  "HAVING total_score > 100")

// Catalyst Optimizer will generate an optimized execution plan for this query
// The plan will include operations such as filtering, sorting, aggregation, and subqueries
